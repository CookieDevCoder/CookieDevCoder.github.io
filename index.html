            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p1>I have many years of experience with coding. I got interested in Coding back in middle school when I took a robotics class.</p1>
            <p1>At first I only coded with block code like in </p1>
            <p1><a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>.</p1>
            <p1>
                But During High School I upgraded to <mark>C#.</mark>
                I started making Unity games. I've created many projects where I tested game mechanics
                and features. trying different ways of implimenting a game mechanic, finding pros and cons to every option.
                I also went into web development for a little. At first it was just <mark>HTML,</mark>
                but eventually I learned <mark>CSS and JavaScript</mark> aswell.
                <br>
                During High School I also Used <mark>JavaScript</mark> for creating a discord bot.
                The discord bot wasn't particularly interesting, it was more of a joke project.
                The bot would look at your message and if it detects a keyword, it would give you a specific reply.
                you were able to ask the bot about itself, tell the bot to say something to a specific User,
                Give commentary on specific topics (typically of a game), and a couple other things.
                I used the <mark>Discord.js API</mark> for the discord bot. This allowed me to send and recieve messages from discord.
                I also used a database in order to store the amount of messages a specific user created.
                The bot would use this information to tell us who talks the most.
                In Terms of Unity Projects, There was a unity project I turned into a mobile game.
                It was a wack-a-mole inspired game. Unfortunately, while the game worked fine, I was not happy with the result
                and decided to take the game down. I added too many unnecessary mechanics that took away from the experience
                rather than adding to it. I took this experience and started to check if a mechanic fits in the game
                and whether it adds to the fun or takes away from it. 
            </p1>
            <h2>Recent Experience</h2>
            <p1>
                Currently I have experience in
                <mark>C#, C++, JavaScript, Python, HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS.</mark>
                I've created many Unity projects over the years. More details on my Unity projects can be seen below this section.
                These projects include Chess, MineSweeper, And Witch day Was it. There are many more minor projects I've created
                mostly as practice for the bigger projects. 
                As a student in <abbr title="California State University, Fullerton">CSUF</abbr>, I learned C++ and various coding concepts.
                I took courses on Object Oriented programming languages, Data Structures, and CyberSecurity.
                In these classes, I have done many assignments where I've had to apply everything I've learned into a program.
                I am currently taking courses on Assembly code, Python, and Software Engineering.
            </p1>

            <h1>Unity projects</h1>
            <p1>I have made many unity projects throughout the years, all experimenting with character controllers, Game mechanics and applying coding concepts I've learned</p1>

            <h2>Witch Day, was it?</h2>
            <a href="https://itch.io/jam/halloween-horror-game-jam/rate/3050519">Download the game on itch.io</a>
            <p1>
                I took part in a halloween Game jam, hosted by the <abbr title="Video Game Development Club">VGDC</abbr> at <abbr title="California State University, Fullerton">CSUF.</abbr>
                We were given 2 days to work on a game. The themes that were given were "Tooth And Nail," "Brews and Broomsticks," and "Gnarly."
                We were tasked with choosing at least one of the themes to create. I opted for "Brews and Broomsticks."
                In my game, you are tasked to foil the witch's plan by destroying her cauldrons filled with her questionable brews.
                You would win once you destroy all her cauldrons and sucessfully make it to your home where you are safe.
                While we were allowed to use external assets, I decided to challenge myself by creating my own assets.
                I wrote all my programming files, along with the player controller, the AI for the witch, and the various interactions in the game.
                I also created all the 3D models and art. 
            </p1>

            <h2>MineSweeper</h2>
            <p1>
                I recreated the Game "MineSweeper" in unity. 
                When you tap on the first tile, the mines are generated.
                they can generate in every tile exept the tile you initially clicked on.
                Afterwards, we check how many mines are surrounding the initial click.
                After calculating that, it will open all tiles that contain 0 mines around itself.
                any tiles that contain a mine around it will show the number of mines that surround that tile.
                You are able to flag tiles. the game is complete once all tiles exept for flagged tiles are uncovered.
                You lose if you click on a mine tile.
            </p1>

            <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p1>
                I recreated the Chess Board game.
                There are a couple of different pieces that can move in various ways.
                These include the Pawn, Bishop, Knight, Rook, King, and Queen.
                The pawn can only move forward and capture diagnally one tile.
                The Bishop can move to any unblocked diagnal tile
                The Knight can Jump over pieces and follows the pattern of moving North East South or West 3 tiles and 1 tile to the right or left relative to the direction moved.
                The Knight is not blocked by pieces that are in the way to the target tile.
                The Rook can move to any unblocked tile Vertically or Horizontally
                The Queen can move Vertically, Horizontally, or diagnally to any unblocked tile.
                The king can move to any of the 8 tiles surrounding the king exept if that tile is guarded by an enemy piece.
                If the enenmy provides a check, The king must be protected in some way during the move.
            </p1>

            <h1>Coding projects</h1>
            <h2>Random Number Guesser</h2>
            <p1>
                Using <mark>c++</mark>, I wrote code where a random number is generated and your task was to guess the number in 3 guesses.
                If you guessed too high, it would tell you that your guess was too high.
                Likewise if you guessed too low, it would tell you that your guess was too low.
                If you guess the number correctly, you would win.
            </p1>
            <h2>Food Waste Tracker</h2>
            <p1>
                As a project for CSUF, I used c++ to create a food waste tracker to track my food waste.
                I was in charge of the backend of the food waste tracker. 
                My task was to find the most effiecient way of storing data for each entry.
                Each entry had the food item, the amount in oz, the cost, the method for disposal, and the reason for disposal.
                I would have to find a way to store the data and also implimenting a way for the front end website to communicate.
                with the back end and vice versa.
